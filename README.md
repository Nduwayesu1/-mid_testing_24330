Create a Java or Maven project and implement the mentioned requirements. You will not need to implement a UI for this project, but you will use Java User Input (Scanner) to insert the data. The person class is the Super Class of User. This class is not created on a database. This system will manage hard copies.
The system will help the institution manage who borrows the books, how many are, when they should return the book, apply charges in case of late return, and so on.
The fine is initialized to zero at the borrow date.
Other users apart from the librarian can create accounts and select his/her preferred membership.
